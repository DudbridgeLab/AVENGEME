Description: AVENGEME (Additive Variance Explained and Number of Genetic Effects Method of Estimation) is a package for the analysis of the polygenic scoring method. Polygenic scores access a large proportion of the heritability of a trait by aggregating genetic effects across thousands of markers into a single composite score. The markers may not be individually associated with the trait at standard statistical significance levels. However, the composite score may be associated, indicating a substantial polygenic component within the score.
