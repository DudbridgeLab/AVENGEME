Description: AVENGEME is a set of R functions for the analysis of the polygenic
    scoring method. In brief, this approach aims to access a large proportion of
    the heritability of a trait by aggregating genetic effects across thousands
    of markers into a single composite "score". The markers are generally not
    individually associated with the trait, at least at standard statistical
    significance levels. However, the composite score may be associated, indicating
    a substantial "polygenic" component within the score. The following setup is
    assumed. Two independent samples of genotype are available; this could be one
    sample of data split into two subsets. One sample is termed the training sample,
    the other the target sample. Traits are measured in each sample; different
    traits could be measured in training and target sample. Subjects are assumed
    to be unrelated, and genotypes assumed to be independent. In practice we
    recommend "LD-clumping" methods, such as the --clump option in PLINK, to ensure
    weak dependence between markers; in this case the methods work well with an
    r2 threshold of 0.1. Markers with P-values within a fixed range are selected
    from the training sample, and then used to construct a polygenic score for each
    subject in the target sample. The score can be tested for association to the
    target trait, or used to predict individual trait values in the target sample.
